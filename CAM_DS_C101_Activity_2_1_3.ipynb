We need to explore whether the applicant’s salary plus the commission will meet affordability (the ability to repay the loan) across various affordability testing aspects.\n",

The applicant has indicated that, on average, they make approximately £550 in commission a month, which would be sufficient. However, sales could fluctuate, which would reduce the commission.\n",
