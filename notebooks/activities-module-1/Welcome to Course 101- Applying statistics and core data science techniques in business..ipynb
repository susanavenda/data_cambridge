        "The most interesting part was using the 5 Whys and CRISP-DM framework to transform \"messy\" qualitative data—like angry customer comments about wait times—into a structured SMART research question. It was fascinating to see how raw human emotion in feedback can be decoded into measurable data points like Velocity (response times) and Veracity (billing accuracy) to reveal systemic business failures.\n",

        "\n",
        "The biggest challenge was distinguishing between symptoms and root causes. It is easy to look at a complaint about a \"rude staff member\" and think the solution is more training. However, the data suggested the \"rudeness\" was a symptom of Support Scalability issues—staff were overwhelmed by a high volume of queries caused by systemic billing errors. Learning to look past the surface-level emotion to find the underlying data-driven problem required a significant shift in perspective.\n",
        "\n",
        "The concept of Feature Engineering as a problem-solving tool is immediately applicable. In any business role, we are often overwhelmed with metrics, but this week taught me to prioritize features that mirror the Customer Journey. Being able to select 5–7 key variables that explain why a customer leaves, rather than just that they left, is a skill that turns a data analyst into a strategic partner who provides actionable wisdom rather than just numbers."
