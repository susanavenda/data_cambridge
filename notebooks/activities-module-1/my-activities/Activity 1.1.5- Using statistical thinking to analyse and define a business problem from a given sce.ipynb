        "## Scenario\n",
        "**Communik8** is a telecommunications company with both online and physical stores. It provides mobile contracts and sells handsets. Recently, the company has experienced a sizeable reduction in new customers and a decrease in the retention of existing customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the primary goal of improving business performance, the company needs to identify critical reasons for this recent decline. The company would like to make sense of its customer data and transform it into actionable insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "The management team at Communik8 has provided recent customer feedback to your team of data scientists and would like initial feedback on the main issues that can be identified from this data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "The goal is to explore and analyse an organisational scenario to identify key problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Assessment criteria\n",
        "By completing this activity, you will be able to provide evidence that you can:\n",
        "* Note common themes and sentiments expressed by customers without performing any in-depth analysis.\n",
        "* Formulate your own business problem statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Activity guidance\n",
        "1. Analyse the customer comments and categorise the comments into themes (e.g. customer service, delivery, billing and payment, and so on).\n",
        "2. Using the themes you identified as guidance, define the problems Communik8's customers are experiencing. (e.g. delays in delivery, website functionality, and so on).\n",
        "3. Identify how solving these problems will help the company achieve its objectives and goals, and outline the consequences of not achieving these goals (e.g. improved customer satisfaction, customer retention, loss of revenue, and so on).\n",
        "4. Write a problem statement based on themes, problems, and solutions you identified."
