        "## Scenario\n",
        "**Communik8** is a telecommunications company with both online and physical stores. It provides mobile contracts and sells handsets. Recently, the company has experienced a sizeable reduction in new customers and a decrease in the retention of existing customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the primary goal of improving business performance, the company needs to identify critical reasons for this recent decline. The company would like to make sense of its customer data and transform it into actionable insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "The management team at Communik8 has provided recent customer feedback to your team of data scientists and would like initial feedback on the main issues that can be identified from this data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "The goal is to explore and analyse an organisational scenario to identify key problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Assessment criteria\n",
        "By completing this activity, you will be able to provide evidence that you can:\n",
        "* Note common themes and sentiments expressed by customers without performing any in-depth analysis.\n",
        "* Formulate your own business problem statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Activity guide\n",
        "1. Analyse the customer comments and categorise the comments into themes (e.g.  customer service, delivery, billing and payment, and so on).\n",
        "2. Using the themes you identified as guidance, define the problems Communik8's customers are experiencing (e.g. delays in delivery, website functionality, and so on).\n",
        "3. Identify how solving these problems will help the company achieve its objectives and goals and outline the consequences of not achieving these goals (e.g. improved customer satisfaction, customer retention, loss of revenue, and so on).\n",
        "4. Write a problem statement based on the themes, problems, and solutions you identified.\n",

        "After reviewing the customer feedback summary, I have categorized the responses into the following **Nominal Categorical** themes:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Customer Service Inefficiency:** Reports of 45-minute wait times and \"useless\" or \"irrelevant\" automated chat responses.\n",
        "* **Logistics & Fulfillment:** Handsets arriving in two weeks despite a 48-hour promise.\n",
        "* **Billing & Contract Errors:** Systemic issues with double-charging and failures to process 14-day cooling-off cancellations.\n",
        "* **Technical Performance:** Persistent \"patchy\" internet and poor mobile coverage.\n",
        "* **Store Staff Conduct:** Negative interactions at physical locations (e.g., Riverside store).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Overall Sentiment:** Highly negative. The recurring theme is a loss of trust due to broken service promises.\n",

        "The core issues Communik8 is facing involve a breakdown between business promises and operational execution:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Support Scalability:** The current digital and phone support systems cannot handle the current **Volume** of queries.\n",
        "2. **Process Veracity:** Billing and cancellation processes are unreliable, creating legal and reputational risks.\n",
        "3. **Logistical Lag:** A failure to meet delivery timelines is driving immediate cancellations of new orders.\n",

        "## 3. Impact and Consequences\n",

        "* **Goals:** Resolving these friction points is essential to stabilizing customer retention and returning to a state of high **Data Maturity**.\n",
        "* **Consequences:** Continued inaction will result in a sustained \"sizeable reduction\" in revenue, market share loss to competitors, and a permanent decline in brand equity.\n",

        "## 4. Business Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "> Communik8 is experiencing a significant decline in customer retention and new acquisitions caused by systemic failures in support response times, billing accuracy, and handset delivery. These operational gaps are resulting in lost revenue and a negative brand reputation. The company must identify the root causes of these service delays and billing errors to implement a data-driven strategy that improves the customer experience and stabilizes the subscriber base.\n",

        "**Process and Rationale:**\n",
        "I applied **Statistical Thinking** to organize unstructured text into measurable themes. By utilizing the **5 Whys** approach, I moved from noting the \"symptoms\" of churn to identifying potential root causes in the company's technical and communication infrastructure.

        "S (Specific): Targets digital support accuracy and billing dispute resolution.\n",

        "The primary challenge in this activity was distinguishing between surface-level symptoms, such as individual complaints about rude staff or signal coverage, and the underlying systemic causes that require a data science intervention. It was difficult to move past the immediate emotional sentiment of the customer feedback to identify broader patterns in data veracity (billing errors) and system velocity (slow response times), ensuring that the proposed solution addressed the root business problem rather than just the symptoms.\n",
