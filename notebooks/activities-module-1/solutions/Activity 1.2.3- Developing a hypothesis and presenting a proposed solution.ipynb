        "# Activity 1.2.3: Developing a hypothesis and presenting a proposed solution\n",
        "\n",
        "## Scenario\n",
        "Developing and testing hypotheses help address organisational challenges and problems with data and broader organisational contexts. Building on the problem statement from the previous activity in Week 1, define a hypothesis and propose a solution related to customer satisfaction factors and their impact on business performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The hypothesis must clearly state the relationship between variables. Frame your hypothesis in a way that allows for data collection and analysis. Note that the hypothesis should be specific and testable. For example, the hypothesis that ‘an increase in dropped calls and network disruptions leads to higher customer churn rates (reduced customer retention)’ is specific and can be tested by correlating network performance data with churn rates over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "The goal is to formulate a hypothesis, identify a cause-and-effect relationship, and create an if–then statement with a possible solution approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Assessment criteria\n",
        "By completing this activity, you will be able to provide evidence that you can:\n",
        "- Formulate your hypothesis.\n",
        "- Identify a cause-and-effect relationship between variables.\n",
        "- Create an if–then statement.\n",
        "- Provide possible solutions and an approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Activity guidance\n",
        "1. Revisit your problem statement from Activity 1.1.5.\n",
        "2. Based on the potential factors identified in the previous activity, create a testable hypothesis statement that proposes a cause-and-effect relationship between variables. The hypothesis must clearly state the relationship between variables and be framed in a way that allows for data collection and analysis. The hypothesis should be specific and testable. For example, the hypothesis that ‘an increase in dropped calls and network disruptions leads to higher customer churn rates (reduced customer retention)’ is specific and can be tested by correlating network performance data with churn rates over time.\n",
        "3. Create an if-then statement to suggest a possible solution approach. For example, **if** the analysis confirms a significant correlation between increased wait times for customer service calls and higher customer churn rates, **then** the company should focus on improving efficiency and responsiveness in its customer service operations.\n",

        "# Model solution\n",
        "\n",
        "### Problem statement\n",
        "\n",
        "CommuniK8 faces critical issues across multiple customer touchpoints, including prolonged wait times, poor customer service quality, rude staff behaviour, misleading contract information, unresolved complaints, website functionality issues, delivery delays, insufficient network coverage, and billing inaccuracies.\n",
        "\n",
        "These challenges undermine customer satisfaction, retention, and brand loyalty, jeopardising long-term revenue and market competitiveness.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address these problems, the company must prioritise reducing wait times, improving staff training, ensuring contract and billing processes transparency, upgrading digital platforms, enhancing delivery timelines, and expanding network coverage.\n",
        "\n",
        "Failure to act will result in irreversible brand erosion, ongoing customer attrition, sustained revenue loss, deteriorating brand reputation, and a weakened competitive position in the telecommunications industry.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Hypothesis statement\n",
        "\n",
        "##### $H_0$ (null hypothesis):\n",
        "* Reducing customer support response time and improving customer service quality has no significant effect on customer satisfaction, customer retention, or business performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### $H_1$ (alternative hypothesis):\n",
        "* Reducing customer support response time and improving customer service quality will significantly increase customer satisfaction, customer retention, and business performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### If-then statement\n",
        "**If** the analysis confirms a significant relationship between customer support response times and improved customer service quality with higher customer satisfaction, retention, and business performance, **then** CommuniK8 should implement a comprehensive solution that includes optimising call routing, increasing staffing during peak hours, introducing more sophisticated AI-driven chatbots for live queries, launching a callback system to reduce wait times, and providing enhanced customer service training focused on empathy, active listening, and problem resolution to improve the overall quality of customer support.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Testing the hypothesis\n",
        "\n",
        "To test the hypothesis, CommuniK8 can use historical data on the following key metrics:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Customer support response time:** Average time it takes to respond to customer support inquiries (e.g. via phone, email, chat).\n",
        "- **Time to closure:** Total time it takes to resolve and close customer complaints, starting from the moment the complaint is logged to the moment it is fully resolved.\n",
        "- **Customer service quality:** Quality rating from customer feedback (e.g. customer satisfaction score, also known as CSAT, or post-interaction surveys).\n",
        "- **Customer satisfaction:** Measured using CSAT or customer reviews/feedback.\n",
        "- **Customer retention:** Measured using customer churn rate (number of customers lost relative to total customers) or repeat purchase rate.\n",
        "- B**usiness performance:** Can be measured using metrics like revenue growth, average order value, and lifetime value (CLV) of customers."
