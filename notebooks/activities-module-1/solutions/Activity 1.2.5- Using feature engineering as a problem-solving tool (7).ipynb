        "## Scenario\n",
        "As you know, **Communik8** has experienced a reduction in both new and existing customers. The Head of Sales has suggested that an analysis of customer behaviour might provide insight into the reason(s) why. To this end, the company has provided you with a list of metrics, or features, from its data to help identify factors influencing customer behaviour. Think about your own experiences as a customer and what factors might influence how, what, and when you purchase something from a vendor. For example:\n",
        "- Customer age\n",
        "- Purchase amount\n",
        "- Location\n",
        "- Loyalty membership\n",
        "- Conversion rate\n",
        "- Gender\n",
        "- Products purchased\n",
        "- Website traffic\n",
        "- Average shipping time\n",
        "- Gross profit margin\n",
        "- Repeat purchase rate\n",
        "- Cart abandonment rate\n",
        "- Inventory turnover rate\n",
        "- Customer support response time\n",
        "- Customer satisfaction score\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "Identify features that influence customer behaviour and provide justification for your choices. In your notebook, you will:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Reflect on and identify five to seven features that you think will provide the best insights into customer behaviour.\n",
        "- Provide a rationale for why you chose these features.\n",

        "| Feature | Rationale for Selection |\n",
        "| --- | --- |\n",
        "| **Customer Support Response Time** | High wait times (45+ mins) were a top complaint. This is a primary driver of **immediate churn**. |\n",
        "| **Average Shipping Time** | Measures the \"broken promise\" gap between the 48-hour guarantee and the reported 2-week reality. |\n",
        "| **Repeat Purchase Rate** | The ultimate indicator of brand health. A drop here signals that existing customers no longer see value. |\n",
        "| **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Score** | Quantifies the qualitative anger found in feedback, allowing us to correlate \"unhappiness\" with \"cancellation.\" |\n",
        "| **Cart Abandonment Rate** | Diagnoses the \"New Customer\" problem. High rates suggest friction in the digital sales funnel or hidden costs. |\n",
        "| **Loyalty Membership** | Allows us to segment the data. Losing \"Gold\" members is a much more severe systemic threat than losing \"Trial\" users. |\n",
        "| **Purchase Amount** | Identifies the **Financial Velocity**. It helps us see if we are losing high-value contract holders or low-tier prepaid users. |\n",

        "### 2. Reflection: Process and Rationale\n",
        "\n",
        "**Process:** My approach was guided by the **CRISP-DM** \"Data Understanding\" phase. I visualized the customer lifecycle—from acquisition (Cart Abandonment) to post-purchase support (Response Time). I deliberately excluded internal financial metrics like \"Inventory Turnover\" because, while important for accounting, they do not explain the **psychology of churn**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Rationale:** By focusing on features that represent **Velocity** (speed of service) and **Veracity** (truth of the billing/experience), I am ensuring the model addresses the *root causes* of the business problem rather than just the symptoms. This ensures the final insights are actionable for the Head of Sales.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 3. Key Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "**In one sentence:** I learned that effective feature engineering is less about the quantity of data and more about selecting variables that serve as \"proxies\" for the real-world human experience and pain points.\n",
