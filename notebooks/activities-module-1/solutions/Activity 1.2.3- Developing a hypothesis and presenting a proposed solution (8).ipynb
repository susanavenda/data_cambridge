Building on the problem statement from the previous activity in Week 1, define a hypothesis and propose a solution related to customer satisfaction factors and their impact on business performance.\n","\n","The hypothesis must clearly state the relationship between variables and be framed in a way that allows for data collection and analysis. The hypothesis should be specific and testable. For example, the hypothesis that ‘an increase in dropped calls and network disruptions leads to higher customer churn rates (reduced customer retention)’ is specific and can be tested by correlating network performance data with churn rates over time.\n","\n","\n","## Objective\n","The goal is to work formulate a hypothesis, identify cause-and-effect relationship, and create an if–then statement with a possible solution approach.\n","\n","\n","## Assessment criteria\n","By completing this activity, you will be able to provide evidence that you can:\n","- Formulate your own hypothesis.\n","- Identify a cause-and-effect relationship between variables.\n","- Create an if–then statement.\n","- Provide possible solutions and an approach.\n","\n","\n","## Activity guide\n","1. Revisit your problem statement from Activity 1.1.5.\n","2. Based on the potential factors identified in the previous activity, create a testable hypothesis statement that proposes a cause-and-effect relationship between variables. The hypothesis must clearly state the relationship between variables and be framed in a way that allows for data collection and analysis. The hypothesis should be specific and testable. For example, the hypothesis that ‘an increase in dropped calls and network disruptions leads to higher customer churn rates (reduced customer retention)’ is specific and can be tested by correlating network performance data with churn rates over time.\n","3. Create an if-then statement to suggest a possible solution approach. For example, **if** the analysis confirms a significant correlation between increased wait times for customer service calls and higher customer churn rates, **then** the company should focus on improving efficiency and responsiveness in its customer service operations.\n","4.

Research Hypothesis\n","\n","> **\"An increase in billing discrepancies and average customer support wait times is positively correlated with a higher rate of customer churn among mobile contract holders.\"**\n","\n","| Variable Type | Variable Name | Description |\n","| --- | --- | --- |\n","| **Independent (IV)** | Billing Error Frequency | Count of billing disputes or reconciliation flags per account. |\n","| **Independent (IV)** | Wait Times | Average time (minutes) a customer spends on hold or in queue. |\n","| **Dependent (DV)** | Churn Rate | Binary outcome: Did the customer terminate their contract? |\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. Causal Mechanism (The \"Why\")\n","\n","* **The Cause:** Inefficient automated systems and manual billing processes generate friction.\n","* **The Effect:** A breakdown in **Data Veracity** leads to a loss of brand trust. Customers perceive the errors as a lack of competence, prompting them to exit the contract at the earliest opportunity.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 3. Proposed Solution (If-Then Roadmap)\n","\n","**Statement:** \"If the data analysis reveals that customers who experience a billing error are **** more likely to churn within **30 days** compared to those who do not, then Communik8 should prioritize the implementation of an **automated billing reconciliation tool** and a **'Fast-Track' support queue** for billing disputes.\"\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 4. Technical Approach & Methodology\n","\n","To validate the hypothesis and implement a fix, the team will execute the following:\n","\n","* **Data Integration:** Merge billing logs with CRM churn records to determine if \"Error Flags\" are leading indicators of \"Cancellation Dates.\"\n","* **Sentiment Analysis:** Apply **NLP** to support chat logs to identify the \"Tipping Point\"—the moment sentiment shifts from problem-solving to churn intent.\n","* **Predictive Modeling:** Develop a **Churn Propensity Model** to provide real-time alerts to the retention team when a high-risk event (e.g., a billing spike) occurs.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 5. Rationale & Reflection\n","\n","* **Deductive Strategy:** By narrowing \"customer unhappiness\" down to billing and wait times, we focus on high-impact, measurable data points (timestamps and transaction logs).\n","* **CRISP-DM Alignment:** This hypothesis ensures the **Data Understanding** and **Data Preparation** phases are targeted, preventing \"analysis paralysis.\"\n","* **Key Insight:** A hypothesis isn't just a guess; it's a structural requirement. It dictates the specific schema and columns required for the model, bridging the gap between business pain and data solutions.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Nq8IMofGbiMU"}}]}
